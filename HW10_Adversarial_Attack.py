## Enviroment & Download

We make use of [pytorchcv](https://pypi.org/project/pytorchcv/) to obtain CIFAR-10 pretrained model, so we need to set up the enviroment first. We also need to download the data (200 images) which we want to attack.

"""## Global Settings

* $\epsilon$ is fixed to be 8. But on **Data section**, we will first apply transforms on raw pixel value (0-255 scale) **by ToTensor (to 0-1 scale)** and then **Normalize (subtract mean divide std)**. $\epsilon$ should be set to $\frac{8}{255 * std}$ during attack.

* Explaination (optional)
    * Denote the first pixel of original image as $p$, and the first pixel of adversarial image as $a$.
    * The $\epsilon$ constraints tell us $\left| p-a \right| <= 8$.
    * ToTensor() can be seen as a function where $T(x) = x/255$.
    * Normalize() can be seen as a function where $N(x) = (x-mean)/std$ where $mean$ and $std$ are constants.
    * After applying ToTensor() and Normalize() on $p$ and $a$, the constraint becomes $\left| N(T(p))-N(T(a)) \right| = \left| \frac{\frac{p}{255}-mean}{std}-\frac{\frac{a}{255}-mean}{std} \right| = \frac{1}{255 * std} \left| p-a \right| <= \frac{8}{255 * std}.$
    * So, we should set $\epsilon$ to be $\frac{8}{255 * std}$ after ToTensor() and Normalize().

* Recall
    * ToTensor() can be seen as a function where $T(x) = x/255$.
    * Normalize() can be seen as a function where $N(x) = (x-mean)/std$ where $mean$ and $std$ are constants.

* Inverse function
    * Inverse Normalize() can be seen as a function where $N^{-1}(x) = x*std+mean$ where $mean$ and $std$ are constants.
    * Inverse ToTensor() can be seen as a function where $T^{-1}(x) = x*255$.

* Special Noted
    * ToTensor() will also convert the image from shape (height, width, channel) to shape (channel, height, width), so we also need to transpose the shape back to original shape.
    * Since our dataloader samples a batch of data, what we need here is to transpose **(batch_size, channel, height, width)** back to **(batch_size, height, width, channel)** using np.transpose.
